                            </p>

                            <h3 class="text-left">GUTPILE Rules:         2 - 6 Players</h3>

                            <p class="text-left">Each player is dealt 4 cards. First player begins by drawing 2 cards, then discards 1 card into a discard pile face up. Players can draw from either the discard or main deck from the top to get your two cards. Once player discards the turn is over.</p>

                            <p class="text-left">To Create a GUTPILE you must collect one of each of these five categories: Weapon, Animal, Gear, Transportation, and Terrain. Once you have a GUTPILE, during your turn you may lay a GP down and take your shot.</p>

                            <p class="text-left">The Weapon will have what numbers you need to roll that count as a hit and any other number is a missed shot. The more difficult the weapon is to use, the harder the number to roll, but your points are greater. If the player misses the shot, the animal is discarded, and the player discards an additional card and turn is over. (The animal does not count as players discard) If the player hits the animal, add up the dice points. (Including the “Shot Placement Die”) Then add up total points in the GP. Certain cards give greater points for using them in combination for a higher point GUTPILE.  Player discards and turn is over.  When a player lays down 3 GUTPILES, player gets an extra 20 points and the game is over.</p>

                            <p class="text-left">All players add up their points. All cards left in your hand count against your total points.</p>

                            <h4>Bonus Cards - Help to add to your GUTPILE.</h4>

                            <p class="text-left">Example – Guide card can carry up to 3 extra Gear Cards, and 1 extra Weapon. These cards would go with the GUTPILE. Duel Hunt Card lets you add a second Animal. (Player must shoot both Animals with the same Weapon.)</p>


                        <h4>Action Cards –</h4> <p>Can be played against either neighbor. If the player cannot defend against the action card, the attacker draws from the defenders hand. The number of cards drawn is stated on the card. The attacker keeps one card and discards the rest in the discard pile under the action card.  That action card cannot be picked up again. This locks all cards under the action card from being picked up. If the neighbor is opposite of the direction of play this also changes the direction of the game and defender loses turn.</p>

                            <p class="text-left">Example – Attacker may play a Rolled Ankle card to either neighbor, if the defender does not have a First Aid Kit card; the player holds up his or her cards and the attacker draws. (Watch out for Hank) If the defender does have the First Aid Kit card, the defender gets the action card to set aside for 5 points and gets to continue with the game by drawing his or her two cards.</p>

                        <h4>Gut Pile Rules</h4>
                            <p class="text-left">Terrain cards - Lists the animals you are allowed to take in this terrain.</p>



                            <h4>Weapon cards -</h4> <p>Lists what number you need to roll on the dice to hit the animal with that specific weapon.</p>

                            <p class="text-left">The harder the weapon, the harder it is to roll the numbers. But come with higher points.</p>

                            (Count your points up after every Gutpile you lay down,) do not double the shot placement die.</p>



                                <h4>Animal Cards -</h4> <p class="text-left">Tags and non tags, If a Park Ranger card is played on you, you must show him all your animals. if you have any non tagged animals you lose all your gear and weapon cards. plus you lose turn. Even if you have tags for all your animals you still lose turn.</p>

                                <h4>State Trooper card acts the same way, however, if you have the Donuts card and don’t have any non tagged animal you do not lose your turn-</h4>



                                    <h4>Gear Cards -</h4>  <p class="text-left">Most gear cards work well when used with the right GP. Keep an eye out for most points available in GP.</p>



                                        <h4>Bonus Cards - Help to add points to your GP. Examples Below-</h4>
                            <p class="text-left">Hank - The worst hunting partner EVER! if you draw Hank in any capacity you cannot discard Hank, He may only be drawn to lose him. However he does defend against the PETA card.  He is -10 points in your hand when the game ends. unless you get 3 GutPiles first. then you have proven to be an excellent Hunter. and he turns into +10.</p>

                            <p class="text-left">Subsistent card can be played in any GP for points. extra points are for using the subsistent card in a GP using Non tagged animals.</p>

                            <p class="text-left">Guide can be used in any GP for extra points. a guide card can carry up to 3 more Gear Cards, and 1 extra Weapon card for maximum points. You may use as many Guides in one hunt as you’d like. You may not use the weapon the guide carries.</p>

                            <p class="text-left">Stealing the Shot  card - you may play this card to anyone in the field,  But choose wisely, Player must hold up all animal cards and you may draw one to keep. if the player has no animals then your turn is over and you lose the Card. (Hank can be added in this category)</p>

                            <p class="text-left">Duel Hunt card - allowed to take 2 animals in a GP. must shoot both animals with the same weapon. if you miss an animal you lose the bonus card and the animal, you may shoot at the second animal. without the added points.</p>



                                            <h4>Action Cards-</h4>
                            <p class="text-left">Can be played against any neighbor, If you play an action card against the rotation of the game, this reverses the direction of the game.</p>
                            <p class="text-left">If the player cannot defend against the card with the appropriate card the defender holds up their cards and attacker draws # of cards indicated on the action card. The attacker looks at cards and takes 1 card and discards the rest under the action card which locks the discard deck from any drawing those cards. An action card cannot be drawn from the discard deck. Examples Below -</p>

                            <p class="text-left">Wolf On the Trail - This card counts as a GP if shot. defender has to have a firearm.</p>

                            <p class="text-left">Bear Attack - Also counts as a GP. if the defender has 2 GP’s and is given this card, and shoots the bear the game is over.</p>

                            <p class="text-left">Alaska State Trooper - checks for Tags. you must show player all your animal tags. if you have animals without tags, you lose all gear and weapons in your hand to the discard pile. and lose turn. If defender has donuts, They do not lose turn. donuts does not get discarded when used with a state trooper. If Defender has a state trooper card as well. He may show his trooper card. (the two troopers talk and they will let you off with a warning) Both trooper cards get discarded.</p>
