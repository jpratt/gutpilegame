                        <h2>Official Hunting Regulations</h2>
                        <h3>2 to 8 players Gameplay lasts one to two hours</h3>
                        <h4 class="text-left">HOW TO WIN:</h4>
                        <p class="text-left">The goal is to build the best hunt (i.e. GUT PILE) but collecting a card from each of the five categories – ANIMAL, WEAPON, TRANSPORTATION, GEAR, and TERRAIN. Through the use of stratagem, discard the right cards while also taking cards from your fellow hunters (PLAYERS). Additionally, when the opportunity arises, play ACTION CARDS against other hunters.</p>
                        <p class="text-left">Count your points after each GUT PILE.</p>
                        <p class="text-left">The first hunter to collect THREE GUT PILES stops the game. The winner of the game is the one who has the most points. For instance, someone who had two successful GUT PILE’s (hunts) may have more points than a hunter with 3 GUT PILES. If you’re stuck with a lot of cards at the end of your hunt, each card counts against you. Deduct the points on your remaining cards from your total.</p>

                        <h4 class="text-left">SET UP:</h4>
                        <p class="text-left">To begin, each player is dealt FOUR cards. The person that been on a hunt most recently starts first. If there are no hunters in the game the last person who saw road kill begins the game.</p>
                        <p class="text-left">The player begins a turn by drawing TWO cards and then looks through their hand for a GUT PILE. They end their turn by discarding ONE card FACE UP in the DISCARD PILE. Players can draw from both the DISCARD PILE and/or the MAIN DECK, unless an ACTION CARD has been played and is on top of the DISCARD PILE. ACTION CARDS lock the pile so you cannot draw from the DISCARD PILE. Once the player has discarded their card, the turn is over.</p>
                        <p class="text-left">If a player has less than FIVE cards in their hand, they must draw to replace the cards at the beginning of their turn.</p>


                        <h4 class="text-left">GAMEPLAY:</h4>
                        <p class="text-left">After you have drawn at the beginning of your turn, you may lay down a GUT PILE (one of the five main categories) and take your SHOT. Each weapon has a degree of difficulty (the number you must roll) to shoot the animal. Roll both Shot Die (Square) and Shot Placement Die (Triangle). The Shot Die determines if you hit your animal. The Shot Placement Die determines where you hit your animal for additional points. Turn over the Shot Placement Die to use the number facing down.</p>
                        <p class="text-left">Be sure to tell your story as you lay down each card – for more fun! Tally up your points and record, then discard a card to end your turn. If you miss the animal by rolling a number not on the WEAPON card, the ANIMAL card is put in the discard pile. The PLAYER must discard an additional card when they miss before the turn ends.</p>


                        <h4 class="text-left">STRATEGY:</h4>
                        <p class="text-left">Attempt to build a high point GUT PILE by taking advantage of extra points on each card, including bonus cards. ACTION cards can slow down a successful hunt when played against other hunters. With collecting the right gear, you can defeat obstacles (ACTION CARD) played against you. Example: Having a water filter would protect against the ACTION card GIARDIA.</p>
                        <p class="text-left">Collect several cards to increase your GUT PILE points. Guides that can carry additional gear, killing with a more primitive weapon, or matching the correct animal to the terrain will yield more points. Be aware of the limitation of your terrain cards.</p>

                        <h4 class="text-left">CARD CATEGORIES:</h4>

                        <h5 class="text-left">Terrain cards- (Required for GUT PILE)</h5>
                        <p class="text-left">You have to leave the house to hunt, but maybe not too far.  Collect a terrain card for your GUT PILE.  Listed on the card are the terrain restrictions or benefits for hunting in that area.</p>

                        <h5 class="text-left">Transportation Cards-(Required for GUT PILE)</h5>
                        <p class="text-left">There are lots of ways to get to your hunt. Collect a transportation card for your GUT PILE. Official regulations do not require the transportation to fit the terrain; however, “house” rules could make the game as real as possible. Read each card carefully since there are a lot of ways to add extra points to your GUT PILE.</p>

                        <h5 class="text-left">Weapon Cards-(Required for GUT PILE)</h5>
                        <p class="text-left">You probably wouldn't take a rock to hunt wild animals; you need a good weapon. But there's always one person who thinks they can (you know who you are). Collect a WEAPON card for your GUT PILE.</p>
                        <p class="text-left">The more primitive the weapon, the higher the possible points.  However, it's harder to kill a bear with a spear than with a firearm. Rolling your Shot Placement Die and Shot Die will determine your points. The cards list the number you must roll to be successful.</p>

                        <h5 class="text-left">Animal Cards-(Required for GUT PILE)</h5>
                        <p class="text-left">No matter what someone tells you, a hunt without getting an animal is just camping.  And just camping is for city folk. Collect an ANIMAL card for your GUT PILE.</p>
                        <p class="text-left">There are advantages to both tagged and non-tagged animals.  But be aware of the dangers of a non-tagged animal. A non-tagged animal is worth more points if taken on a private land terrain. But, if a PARK RANGER card is played on you, you must show them all your animals. If you have any non-tagged animals, you lose all your gear, weapons cards, and your turn.  A STATE TROOPER card can ruin your hunt even more.</p>

                        <h5 class="text-left">Gear Cards-(Required for GUT PILE)</h5>
                        <p class="text-left">We've all done it, going on a hunt without the right gear is difficult! Collect your gear now for your GUT PILE.  Keep an eye out for most points available in a GUT PILE.  Some GEAR cards also will help defeat ACTION cards, so you may want to hold onto them.  Also, remember if you have a guide they can help carry additional gear.</p>

                        <h5 class="text-left">Bonus Cards-(Not Required for GUT PILE but presents a challenge!)</h5>

                        <h6 class="text-left">Hank-</h6>
                        <p class="text-left">The worst hunting partner EVER!</p>
                        <p class="text-left">If you draw Hank in any capacity, you cannot discard the card.  The only way to get rid of Hank is, hopefully, another player draws him from your hand during game play.  However, he does defeat the PETA card.  He is -10 points in your hand when the game ends.</p>

                        <h6 class="text-left">Subsistence-</h6>
                        <p class="text-left">Hunting to support yourself for food or trade.</p>
                        <p class="text-left">May be played in any GUT PILE for points. Maximizes points when used in conjunction with a non-tagged animal.</p>

                        <h6 class="text-left">Guide-</h6>
                        <p class="text-left">A guide in a GUT PILE, you will gain additional points.  A guide can carry up to 3 more pieces of gear, and one extra weapon card for maximum points. You may use as many Guides in one GUT PILE as you would like. If your guide has a weapon, you cannot use it to take your animal.</p>

                        <h6 class="text-left">Stealing the Shot-</h6>
                        <p class="text-left">You may play this card to anyone in the field.  But choose wisely, a player must hold up all their ANIMAL cards, and you may draw one to keep. If the player has no animals, then you must discard your Stealing the Shot Card, and your turn is over.  Be careful, the other player is allowed put Hank in the mix for you to draw.</p>

                        <h6 class="text-left">Dual Hunt-</h6>
                        <p class="text-left">Hunting with a Dual Hunt card enables you to bag two animals. You must shoot both animals with the same weapon. If you miss an animal, you lose the bonus card and the animal.  However, you may shoot at the second animal, without the added points.  If you miss both animals, then you must discard both ANIMAL cards and the BONUS card.</p>

                        <h5 class="text-left">Action Cards-(Not required but may be useful)</h5>
                        <p class="text-left">Used to hinder another player from getting a GUT PILE.  The defender attempts to defeat the action with the appropriate gear.  If the player does not have the proper gear, the defender holds up their cards and the attacker draws the number of cards indicated on the action card. The attacker looks at cards and chooses one card, and then discards the rest. (If Hank is drawn, remember you must not discard him, now he's your worst hunting buddy.) The discarded cards go under the ACTION card; this locks the discard deck from anyone drawing those cards. An ACTION card cannot be drawn from the discard deck.</p>
                        <p class="text-left">All ACTION cards – with the exception of Park Ranger and State Trooper – must be played to the neighbor on your right or left. The direction of the game is changed when the ACTION card is played on a neighbor.  The neighbor also loses their turn if they can't defeat the action card.</p>

                        <h6 class="text-left">Wolf on the Trail-</h6>
                        <p class="text-left">Wolves are Nature’s eco-terrorists. If they are on the trail, then there's a good chance a fierce competitor is taking the game. If someone plays this ACTION card and the wolf is shot it, counts as one of their GUT PILES.  The defender has to have a firearm to shoot at the wolf.</p>

                        <h6 class="text-left">Bear Attack-</h6>
                        <p class="text-left">One animal who may not appreciate you in their territory is a Bear. Along a mountainside or hiking a trail, they may suddenly attack.</p>
                        <p class="text-left">If someone plays this ACTION card and the bear is shot, it counts as one of their GUT PILES.  The defender has to have a firearm to shoot at the bear.</p>

                        <h6 class="text-left">Alaska State Trooper-</h6>
                        <p class="text-left">They sneak up on you – even in the most remote areas – asking for your papers. You must show all your animal tags. If you have animals without tags, you lose all gear, weapons, and transportation in your hand to the discard pile, then go to jail. However, if the defender has donuts this defeats the Trooper, the Trooper is discarded, and the turn is over. If the defender has a state trooper card as well. He may show his Trooper card. Once the Troopers talk it out, you will simply lose your ANIMAL cards to the discard pile, and be let off with a warning. Both trooper cards get discarded. If the player is in jail, they lose three turns, unless they roll an even number on the die on their next turn.</p>

                        <h6 class="text-left">Park Ranger (Fish Cop)-</h6>
                        <p class="text-left">Natures Tactical Boy Scout, keeping the wilderness ship-shape. If played, the defender must have all animals tagged.  If they have no tags, they lose all animals, weapons and transportation.  Park Ranger cannot be defeated. However, they won't take you to jail.</p>
